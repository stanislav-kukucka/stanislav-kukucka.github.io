## Stanislav Kukucka

#### Last years and during staying in Asia i have been working on various long/short term contracts that made my work experience look more flighty &amp; lively that usual. I have found my self bridging the gap between product, sales and marketing with little bit of dev skills. It's then easier for me to find shortcut in acquisition path known as "growth hacking". I'm into courageous & fluffy digital products that are like munchies to certain market.
