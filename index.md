# Stanislav Kukucka
###Last years and during staying in Asia i have been working on various long/short term contracts that made my work experience look more flighty &amp; lively that usualy workers have. 
###I have found my self bridging the gap between product, sales and marketing with little bit of dev skills. 
###It's then easier for me to find shortcut in acquisition path known as "growth hacking".
